I have created 2 projects in Python Programming.
Firstly, a stone-paper-scissors game with a perfect and simple GUI and User Interaction and the other is a Password Generator which is again a very useful project with a perfect GUI.
The codes are created by me and are uploaded in this repo along with a demo video to each project.
